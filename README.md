# DLSDetectorApp
An android app, what implements Firebase Live Labeling and Live Detection

# Bring this app to live
This app works but requires a Firebase project to compile. 
I do not include my project configuration in the sources.
In order to compile this, you need to:

- Create a Firebase project
- Add an app in the Firebase console
- Download the google-service.json and past it into the app folder
